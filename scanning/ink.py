"""Measure where the marks are on a page, without a text layer.

The pipeline stopped embedding a Tesseract text layer, so the geometry
helpers that used to ask ``page.get_text("words")`` where the printed
text sits have nothing to read on a ``bitonal.pdf``. A bitonal page is
black marks on white, so the same question can be answered from the
pixels: render the page, threshold it, and project the dark pixels onto
each axis.

Used by :mod:`scanning.margins` (page content box) and by
``services._ink_text_geometry`` (drop-in replacements for blackletter's
text-bound helpers while redaction rects are computed).
