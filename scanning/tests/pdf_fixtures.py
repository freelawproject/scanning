"""Builders for small synthetic PDFs used by the geometry tests.

The pipeline's PDFs come in two flavors and the geometry code has to work
with both: a page with a real text layer, and a ``bitonal.pdf``-style page
that is a single 1-bit image with no text at all. These helpers produce
both, plus the scanner artifacts (a solid band along a page edge) that the
ink measurements have to ignore.
